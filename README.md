## Libraries

This repository also provides `x264` and `l-smash` static libraries for popular platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac and Android). *If you have corresponding license* for x264 and willing to fully open-source your Unreal project code you can probably use x264. However, this is not a legal advice, ask experts.
